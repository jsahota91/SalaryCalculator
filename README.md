# Test method
- Arrange - set up values, initial conditions, instantiate objects needed
- Act - invoke methods with parameters on the objects we initialised
- Assert - check the values we get back are what we expect

## Method name 
Consists of three parts:
1. The method/ unit of work you are testing
2. The inital condition
3. Expected results

## TDD
TDD uses **Red-Green-Refactor** process which involves:
- Red: Write the test (it should fail)
- Green: Write enough code to made (it should pass)
- Refactor: Make changes to improve how the code is written
- Then repeat the cycle to enable all conditions to be met.
